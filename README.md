# Sankyo_shutter_wheel_removal  

You will need a small set of precision screwdrivers for this job.
Remove back cover.  
Remove the belt from the cam. Slide the belt over the fan blades and out.  
Remove 4 motor mounting screws with washers.  Use magnetic screwdriver to  ensure that the washers come out together   
with the screws.  
Slide the motor assembly out and leave eit hanging out on the side and out of the way with the wires still connected.  
Remove the fan shroud by undoing the 2 mounting screws.  
Remove 3 Claw and terminal strip mounting screws. Be careful not to lose the washers.

Remove the claw mechanism by grabbing it from the back and pulling a bit to the left and then out.  
Do not apply any force. You should be able to wiggle it out.

Remove cam bushing mounts and the lubrication felt pads.

Remove the blade assembly.  
Losen the shutter blade shaft screws and the mounting screws and slide the shutter blade assembly out. Then remove the shutter wheel  
and reinstall the cam back onto the shaft. Note: the cam lock screws with have to bee loosened and cam realiigned during the  
last steps of the procedure.  
Lubricate cam bushings and install the felp pads back in. They go into a recess between the bushing and the mounting post  
not under the bushing. This could throw your cam alignment off.  
Slide the claw mechanism back in. Double check the image to figure out where it goes.  This one is a bit tricky.  
Do not force anything. The claw may bind a bit at the front. You can wiggle the assembly a bit to the left and that   
will free up the claw.

Slide the claw assembly in. You need to open up the assembly a bit against the spring so that the claw level sits on the  
cam hub and the bottom frame alignment post gets engaged with the framer control lever.
Also check the mounting tabs on the assembly. They should be over the mounting posts if the claw assembly is in properly.  
Screw the assembly in using the mounting screws.   
The top mounting screw is shared with the terminal strip. The strip mounting tab fits on top of the claw assembly tab and then teh washer goes on top   
of that.
Do not forget the 2nd terminal strip screw and the belt.
Reinstall thee fan shroud and the motor. The motor reinstall is a bit tricky and it is easy to lose the washers.  
One possible solution is to place the screws and washers ontto the motor mounts and put a piece of sticky tape to keep them  
in place and then slide the motor down close to its resting place and then carefully drive the screws in one by one and then  
finally tighten them.  
Reinstall the belt. 
Check thee claw alignement by observing its movemenet from the front while manually rotating the fan blades.
The claw  should go up and down and swing from left to right. Once the claw is all the way to the right, it should be   
very close to the gate frame but it should not be scraping it.  
If not, then loosen the cam shaft lock screws and slide the cam assembly on the shaft, left or right until the  
proper alignment is achieved. This step is a bit tricky but take your time until it is done right.  
You can also do a test run with the film but make sure to run  it manually by pushing the fan blades. 
The claw operation should be smooth without binding anywhere. 
Running it without proper alignment can reresult in damaged or broken claw.  
This completes the procedure.
